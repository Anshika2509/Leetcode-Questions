## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform that provides a wide range of coding problems, from easy to hard. 
Solving these problems can be a great way to improve your coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. 
This repository aims to provide solutions to some of the LeetCode questions along with explanations to help others understand the solutions better.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a specific LeetCode question. Inside each folder, you will typically find:

- The solution code in one or more programming languages majorly in Java.
- A README file explaining the problem statement and providing additional details about the solution.
- Test cases or sample inputs to verify the correctness of the solution.

Here's an example folder structure for a LeetCode question:

```
/ProblemName
  â”œâ”€â”€ solution.java
  â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
  â”œâ”€â”€ test_cases/
      â”œâ”€â”€ input1.txt
      â”œâ”€â”€ input2.txt
      â”œâ”€â”€ output1.txt
      â”œâ”€â”€ output2.txt
```



If you would like to contribute a solution in a different programming language, please feel free to do so. 
Just make sure to include a README file explaining the solution and, if possible, test cases for verification.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome!
